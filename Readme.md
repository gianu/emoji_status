# The incredible Emoji Status 😍 

Are you tired of getting always the same boring result when you ask for the last status of a program?

Why I only get a 0 or another boring number?

Meet Emojis Status!, your friendly status.

Now when you need to know the status of your last command just run:

```shell
last_status
```

and you will get a 💣  if something went wrong, or a 🏆  if everything went well.

Say goodbye to the boring status!
